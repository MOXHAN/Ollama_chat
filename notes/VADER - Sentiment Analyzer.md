**VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) is a **rule-based** and **lexicon-based** sentiment analysis tool specifically designed to evaluate sentiments expressed in social media contexts. It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) for analyzing the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of short text data, such as tweets, movie reviews, and product opinions.

## Key Features of VADER:

1. **Predefined Lexicon**:
    
    - VADER comes with a predefined lexicon of words associated with specific sentiment scores (from -1 for extreme negative to +1 for extreme positive).
    - Each word in the lexicon has an associated valence score, which contributes to the overall sentiment score of the text.
2. **Handles Social Media Text**:
    
    - VADER is tailored to handle **slang**, **emojis**, and **expressive punctuation** commonly found in social media posts (e.g., "!!!" amplifies sentiment, "lol" can indicate positive sentiment).
    - Emojis and emoticons are converted into their respective words, and their sentiment contributions are accounted for.
3. **Heuristic Rules**:
    
    - VADER applies several heuristic rules to adjust sentiment scores based on **contextual factors**:
        - **Punctuation**: More exclamation marks increase sentiment intensity (e.g., "great!!!" is more positive than "great!").
        - **Capitalization**: Uppercase words are perceived as more intense (e.g., "GREAT" is more positive than "great").
        - **Degree Modifiers**: Words like "very" or "extremely" amplify sentiment, while words like "slightly" dampen it.
        - **Contrastive Conjunctions**: Phrases like "but" flip the sentiment context (e.g., "The movie was good, but the ending was bad" emphasizes the negative sentiment of the ending).
4. **Output**:
    
    - VADER produces a sentiment score for a piece of text, giving proportions for **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative** sentiment. The final sentiment score is normalized between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive).

### Advantages:

- **No training required**: VADER is a rule-based approach, which means there is no need for labeled data or model training.
- **Real-time analysis**: VADER can be used for quick, real-time sentiment scoring.
- **Transparent and adjustable**: The lexicon and rules can be adapted for specific use cases if needed.

### Limitations:

- **Limited Context Understanding**: VADER may struggle with understanding deep context, negations, or sarcasm over long passages of text.
- **Static Lexicon**: As a lexicon-based method, VADER can miss out on new words or phrases not present in its dictionary.

### Simple code implementation

````Python
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

vader = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

test_data["vader_score"] = test_data.text.apply(
    lambda x: vader.polarity_scores(x)['compound'])

# mapping to 5-star rating
def mapper(x):

    if x >= 0.6:
        return 5
    elif x >= 0.2:
        return 4
    elif x >= -0.2:
        return 3
    elif x >= -0.4:
        return 2
    else:
        return 1

test_data['vader_polarity'] = test_data.vader_score.apply(lambda x: mapper(x))

test_data.head()

VADER is popular for its ease of use and performance in social media analysis. If you need a more advanced approach that captures the deeper context or semantics of words, techniques such as **Word Embeddings** or **TF-IDF** may be more appropriate. You can find more information on these methods in the [[TF-IDF]] and [[embeddings]].
